<H2>Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classification</H2>
This classification model is designed specifically for the MNIST handwritten dataset.
It operates on the foundation of Bayes' theorem and employs the Bernoulli distribution and have the accuracy about 83%.
This model provides an intuitive and straightforward solution but has the limitation that it utilizes a binomial distribution even when dealing with data that follows a continuous distribution.
