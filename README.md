<H2>Text Classification with Naive Bayes</H2>
<p>Overview : This text classification model is built using a probabilistic algorithm derived from Bayes' theorem. It involves obtaining the news data from scikit-learn, which consists of 20 categories, and then undergoing a training process. After training, the model is tested using a test dataset for actual classification. Subsequently, the accuracy is evaluated, and the model is assessed through the examination of a confusion matrix and a histogram.</p>
