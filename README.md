<H2>Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classification</H2>
This classification model is designed specifically for the MNIST handwritten dataset.
It operates on the foundation of Bayes' theorem and employs the Bernoulli distribution, providing an intuitive and straightforward solution.
The limitation of this model is that it utilizes a binomial distribution even when dealing with data that follows a continuous distribution, and its accuracy is not particularly high.
